## :lady_beetle: Bugs

*   The transition between the player bar and player screen is awkward and should be replaced with a Deezer-like transition;
*   There is an awkward display bug in the details screen and with the player bar in landscape mode due to the use of SafeAreas and ListTiles;
*   Some home tiles are not and will not be implemented (Concerts, Did you know, Original videos, ...);
*   [Tell me!](https://github.com/PetitPrinc3/Deezer/issues)
